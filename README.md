• **Overview**

WHAT THE FUCK AM I DOING WITH MY LIFEEEEEE 😭😭😭😭

• **Actual Overview this time, forget my cries**

This is basically a Python Github repo that basically logs in to a Discord Bot. Sounds _pretty simple_ amirite? Well no dumbass, this here is a Github Repo that tries different strings to log in to a Discord Bot, once logged in, it immediately logs out and logs the token for the user to do **_things_** to it yk what I'm saying? _😏_ (okay Ira, enough with the corny shit and get right on to it)

• **Usage**

Before running the main.py code, remember to:

- NOT SKID
- DON'T FIDDLE DIDDLE WITH THE MAIN CODE
- LEAVE ME SUGGESTIONS FOR THE LOVE OF THE ALLFATHER (and bugs to be fixed)
- RUN investigator.py FIRST TO GET THE TIMESTAMP OF THE BOT

• **Preparation**

Install discord.py. You already know how to do _that_ right? Second of all, go to the Discord Developer Portal and create a bot. This is for investigator.py. Get its token and run investigator.py. Invite it to a empty server then type: "v!creation {target_id}". Remember to try this on BOTS, not PEOPLE because I don't want either of us to get toxxed AND to break Discord.

• **Q & A**

**Why do this?**
I was bored

**Why do I need to run investigator.py first?**
Where do you expect to get the Timestamp? The reason why Bot ID and Timestamp (UTC) is needed is becoz for MAX efficiency. Try the code for yourself cuz ion wan to get toxxed (i didnt test it yet).

**Are you gay?**
No.
